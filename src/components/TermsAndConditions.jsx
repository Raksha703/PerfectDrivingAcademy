        <p>
          I confirm that I am an adult and physically fit to undergo driving training. I have voluntarily chosen to enroll in the training and have informed and obtained permission from my family members.
        </p>

        <p>
          In case of any damage caused to the academyâ€™s car or to a third party during the training session conducted by me, I agree to take full responsibility for the loss. The academy's trainer or institution will not be held liable for any such incidents.
        </p>

        <p>
          Our institution is a privately owned enterprise that provides personal-use car driving training to adult citizens.
        </p>

        <p>
          Upon completion of the training, our institution will issue a certificate for informational purposes only. This certificate is not a substitute for a government-issued driving license. To obtain a license, students must appear for the RTO test separately.
        </p>

        <p>
          Our training services are strictly for personal-use car driving. We do not provide training for passenger transport, commercial use, or heavy vehicles.
        </p>

        <p>
          The training course spans 15 days. After this period, the session is considered complete and no extensions will be provided.
        </p>

        <p>
          It is mandatory for all students to follow the instructions of the trainer throughout the training. Any involvement in inappropriate or illegal activities will result in immediate termination of the training.
        </p>

        <p>
          Students are not permitted to drive any vehicle independently until they have completed at least 10 lessons at the academy. Any violations will be the sole responsibility of the student.
